# Classification-Gender-Voice-Recognition
Classification and Clustering of Gender by Voice Recognition Using NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Agglomerative Algorithms in Python.

Oral language is the most natural way for humans to convey information. Speech signals provide several different types of information. From a speech point of view, it conveys speech signals, linguistic information (eg message) and speaker information (eg emotional, regional and physiological characteristics). From the point of view of speech perception, it also provides information about the environment in which speech is produced and transmitted. Even though this wide range of information is encoded in a complex form of a speech signal by a human voice device, humans can easily decrypt much of information. The existence of such an ability in humans has inspired many researchers to understand speech in order to develop systems that automatically learn and process this information. This technology has found wide applications such as **automatic dictation**, **voice command control**, **voice archive indexing**, **Voice retrieval** and so on.

This Project contains two phases of **Data Collection** and **Classification Implementation**.
